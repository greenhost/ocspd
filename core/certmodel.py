"""
This module defines the :class:`core.certmodel.CertModel` class which is
used to keep track of certificates that are found by the
:class:`core.certfinder.CertFinderThread`, then parsed by the
:class:`core.certparser.CertParserThread`, an OCSP request is generated by the
:class:`core.ocsprenewer.OCSPRenewer`, a response from an OCSP server is
returned. All data generated and returned like the request and the response are
stored in the context.

The following logic is contained within the context class:

 - Parsing the certificate.
 - Validating parsed certificates and their chains.
 - Generating OCSP requests.
 - Sending OCSP requests.
 - Processing OCSP responses.
 - Validating OCSP responses with the respective certificate and its chain.
