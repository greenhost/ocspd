Module description
==================

Ocspd consists of several modules that interact with each other in order to keep
OCSP staples up-to-date. In short, these are the modules:

:Scheduler:
    It is possible to schedule a task with the scheduler. It will wait
    for the scheduled moment and add the task to a queue to be handled by one
    of the other modules.
:Finder:
    Finds certificates and parses them. If certificates are correct, it
    schedules a renewal for these certificates
:Renewer:
    The renewer takes input from the scheduler. It contacts the CA to
    renew an OCSP staple. After renewing the staple it schedules a new
    renewal and tells the scheduler to call the adder right away.
:Adder:
    This is a module that can talk to the HAProxy socket to add OCSP
    staples without restarting HAProxy.

This graph explains their interaction. Every arrow passes a
:class:`~core.certmodel.CertModel` instance to the other module.
